The throttled function comes with a `cancel`\n\t * method to cancel delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to\n\t * immediately invoke them. Provide `options` to indicate whether `func`\n\t * should be invoked on the leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait`\n\t * timeout. The `func` is invoked with the last arguments provided to the\n\t * throttled function. Subsequent calls to the throttled function return the\n\t * result of the last `func` invocation.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\n\t * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the throttled function\n\t * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n\t *\n\t * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\n\t * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\n\t *\n\t * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n\t * for details over the differences between `_.throttle` and `_.debounce`.\n\t *\n\t * @static\n\t * @memberOf _\n\t * @since 0.1.0\n\t * @category Function\n\t * @param {Function} func The function to throttle.\n\t * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to throttle invocations to.\n\t * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.leading=true]\n\t *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n\t * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n\t *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n\t * @returns {Function} Returns the new throttled function.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * // Avoid excessively updating the position while scrolling.\n\t * jQuery(window).on('scroll', _.throttle(updatePosition, 100));\n\t *\n\t * // Invoke `renewToken` when the click event is fired, but not more than once every 5 minutes.\n\t * var throttled = _.throttle(renewToken, 300000, { 'trailing': false });\n\t * jQuery(element).on('click', throttled);\n\t *\n\t * // Cancel the trailing throttled invocation.\n\t * jQuery(window).on('popstate', throttled.cancel);\n\t */\n\tfunction throttle(func, wait, options) {\n\t  var leading = true,\n\t      trailing = true;\n\t\n\t  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n\t    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n\t  }\n\t  if (isObject(options)) {\n\t    leading = 'leading' in options ? !!options.leading : leading;\n\t    trailing = 'trailing' in options ? !!options.trailing : trailing;\n\t  }\n\t  return debounce(func, wait, {\n\t    'leading': leading,\n\t    'maxWait': wait,\n\t    'trailing': trailing\n\t  });\n\t}\n\t\n\tmodule.exports = throttle;\n\n\n/***/ },\n/* 376 */\n/***/ function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\tvar isObject = __webpack_require__(15),\n\t    isSymbol = __webpack_require__(61);\n\t\n\t/** Used as references for various `Number` constants. */\n\tvar NAN = 0 / 0;\n\t\n\t/** Used to match leading and trailing whitespace. */\n\tvar reTrim = /^\\s+|\\s+$/g;\n\t\n\t/** Used to detect bad signed hexadecimal string values. */\n\tvar reIsBadHex = /^[-+]0x[0-9a-f]+$/i;\n\t\n\t/** Used to detect binary string values. */\n\tvar reIsBinary = /^0b[01]+$/i;\n\t\n\t/** Used to detect octal string values. */\n\tvar reIsOctal = /^0o[0-7]+$/i;\n\t\n\t/** Built-in method references without a dependency on `root`. */\n\tvar freeParseInt = parseInt;\n\t\n\t/**\n\t * Converts `value` to a number.\n\t *\n\t * @static\n\t * @memberOf _\n\t * @since 4.0.0\n\t * @category Lang\n\t * @param {*} value The value to process.\n\t * @returns {number} Returns the number.\n\t * @example\n\t *\n\t * _.toNumber(3.2);\n\t * // => 3.2\n\t *\n\t * _.toNumber(Number.MIN_VALUE);\n\t * // => 5e-324\n\t *\n\t * _.toNumber(Infinity);\n\t * // => Infinity\n\t *\n\t * _.toNumber('3.2');\n\t * // => 3.2\n\t */\n\tfunction toNumber(value) {\n\t  if (typeof value == 'number') {\n\t    return value;\n\t  }\n\t  if (isSymbol(value)) {\n\t    return NAN;\n\t  }\n\t  if (isObject(value)) {\n\t    var other = typeof value.valueOf == 'function' ? value.valueOf() : value;\n\t    value = isObject(other) ?
